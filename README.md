# Arduino-binary-lcd-clock-and-sensors
An binary clock displayed on 2*16 LCD screen. Also features alarm clock, automatic dimming, light sensor, temperature, and humidity. 
It is not perfect but it works, hopefully soon there will be a pin out diagram for this, in addition to the required libraries (1/19/18)
If you have any suggestion on how to simplify the clock portion of the code please let me know in the comment section!
